## What are you looking at?

#### This is a modular game engine architecture for StarkNet - a L2 vailidity proof roll-up.
Forked & heavily inspired by the pioneering work done by the Dope Ware RYO game [here](https://github.com/dopedao/RYO).

There documents are a all open source and are a work in progress.

### Overview

Settling is an on-chain game of economics and Chivalry built on-top of ZK-STARKS. Earn resources by staking your Realms, raid rivals, steal loot & form on-chain alliances to crush your enemies.

Settling is entirely on-chain; the UI is purely just a client for a distributed backend. Feel free to create your own superior client if you wish.

The game is all open-source and we encourage people to build modules and contribute.
